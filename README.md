## Introduction

The "Remote Module" module in dDock is used to connect to gRPC services that can be written in a variety of languages
and can be running on your own machine or on another machine elsewhere over the network. You can find the official gRPC
documentation [here](https://grpc.io/).

You can use this module to run code you have written in another language, with only a few dozen additional lines of code
to your existing project. The current list of languages you can write in is [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).
